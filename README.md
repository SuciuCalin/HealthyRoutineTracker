# Habit Tracker App
<h2>Project Overview:</h2>

This project is a chance for you to combine and practice everything you learned in this section of the Nanodegree program. You'll be setting up and using the database schema for a simple habit tracking app.

The goal is to design and create the structure of a Habit Tracking app which would allow a user to store and track their habits over time. <b><i>This project will not have any UI components</i></b>; instead, you will focus on what happens behind the scenes, practicing how to design and implement a simple database.

<h3>Requirements</h3>

<ul>
<li><b>No UI is required for this project.</b></li>
<br>
<li><b>The code compiles without errors.</li></b>
<br>
<li><b>There exists a contract class that defines name of table and constants.
<br>Inside the contract class, there is an inner class for each table created.</b></li>
<br>
<li><b>There exists a subclass of SQLiteOpenHelper that overrides onCreate() and onUpgrade().</b></li>
<br>
<li><b>There is a single insert method that adds at least two values of two different datatypes (e.g. INTEGER, STRING) into the database using a ContentValues object and the insert() method.</li></b>
<br>
<li><b>There is a single read method that returns a Cursor object. It should get the data repository in read and use the query() method to retrieve at least one column of data.</li></b>
<br>
<li><b>No external libraries (e.g. Realm) are used for the database code, and no Content Providers is used. All data insertion and reading should be done using direct method calls to the SQLite database in the SQLiteOpenHelper class.</li></b>
<br>
<li><b>Code is easily readable such that a fellow programmer can understand the purpose of the app.</li></b>
<br>
<li><b>All variables, methods, and resource IDs are descriptively named such that another developer reading the code can easily understand their function.</li></b>
<br>
<li><b>The code is properly formatted i.e. there are no unnecessary blank lines; there are no unused variables or methods; there is no commented out code.
The code also has proper indentation when defining variables and methods.</li></b>
</ul><br>
